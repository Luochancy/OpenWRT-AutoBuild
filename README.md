A template for building OpenWrt with GitHub Actions

## Usage

- Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/P3TERX/Actions-OpenWrt/generate) button to create a new repository.
- Generate `.config` files using [Lean's OpenWrt](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) source code. ( You can change it through environment variables in the workflow file. )
- Push `.config` file to the GitHub repository.
- Select `Build OpenWrt` on the Actions page.
- Click the `Run workflow` button.
- When the build is complete, click the `Artifacts` button in the upper right corner of the Actions page to download the binaries.

## Tips

- It may take a long time to create a `.config` file and build the OpenWrt firmware. Thus, before create repository to build your own firmware, you may check out if others have already built it which meet your needs by simply [search `Actions-Openwrt` in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Actions-openwrt).
- Add some meta info of your built firmware (such as firmware architecture and installed packages) to your repository introduction, this will save others' time.

## Sysupgrade Support

This configuration includes sysupgrade firmware generation support for OpenWRT. The build process will generate firmware files that can be used for online system upgrades.

### Generated Files
- `.img.gz` - Complete installation image
- `.tar.gz` - Sysupgrade upgrade package for online updates
- Additional platform-specific upgrade files

### Usage
1. **Web Interface**: Upload the sysupgrade file through LuCI Web Interface → System → Backup/Upgrade
2. **Command Line**: 
   - Standard upgrade: `sysupgrade -v firmware.bin`
   - Keep configuration: `sysupgrade -v -c firmware.bin`

### Notes
- x86_64 platform sysupgrade support is optimized for virtual and physical hardware
- Always backup your configuration before upgrading
- Test without preserving configuration first for major updates
